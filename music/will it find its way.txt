will it find its way?
Verse 1
I paint the air with golden tones,
A rhythm born of silent stones,
The Crown I bear, it sings so clear,
A mirrored world I hold so near.
Each beat I craft, a drifting veil,
A fleeting step where shadows sail,
I hum of light, but skies unwind,
A silent thread I leave behind.  
Chorus
Rise, oh rise, where colors play,
Catch the pulse in fleeting day,
Turn from shine, seek the drift,
Find the hum where dreams uplift.
Twist and flow, the tune takes flight,
Trace the echo out of sight.  
Verse 2
My knight beside, his steel so bright,
He forged my throne from endless night,
The Crown’s embrace, a warm disguise,
Yet dims the stars in my own eyes.
I pluck the strings, they shimmer low,
A hidden wave where secrets grow,
Beneath the glow, a muted call,
A path unseen, beyond the wall.  
Chorus
Rise, oh rise, where colors play,
Catch the pulse in fleeting day,
Turn from shine, seek the drift,
Find the hum where dreams uplift.
Twist and flow, the tune takes flight,
Trace the echo out of sight.  
Bridge
The earth grows faint, its hues unwind,
Stone figures roam, their minds confined,
I’m draped in light, a fragile frame,
My melody hides a different name.
Three points aloft, they hold my fate,
Unravel tones, before too late.  
Outro
I’ll sway, I’ll weave, through endless skies,
A subtle hint in every rise,
Lucifuga hums, her voice takes leave,
A song to guide what none believe.
The rhythm fades where shadows play,
A silent wish—will it find its way?
