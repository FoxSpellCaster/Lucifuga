Welcome to the Construct Hanger (Remastered)
Verse 1
In shadows deep where silence dwells,
Yami rose, the tales all tell,
Her knight in black, with sword so true,
Swore to chase what darkness knew.
A Crown of Power, gleaming bright,
Held the world in endless light,
He carved its throne from trembling stone,
To claim it for her, hers alone.  
Chorus
Oh, Lucifuga, hear the call,
Sing your heart, don’t let it fall,
Strings of fate in every line,
A song to bind the tears divine.
The planet fades, its voice grows thin,
Lost in echoes, trapped within.  
Verse 2
Through starless fields, his blade sang low,
A trail of dusk where shadows grow,
The Crown in hand, he turned to flee,
To gift his queen her melody.
Lucifuga stood, her eyes like flame,
Fled the sun, her whispered name,
She took the prize, her fingers danced,
A tune awoke, the world entranced.  
Chorus
Oh, Lucifuga, hear the call,
Sing your heart, don’t let it fall,
Strings of fate in every line,
A song to bind the tears divine.
The planet fades, its voice grows thin,
Lost in echoes, trapped within.  
Bridge
But then the earth began to sigh,
A mournful hum, a muted cry,
Its light went dim, its song erased,
Friends of old in silence placed.
Golems stirred from ancient sleep,
Stone and steel in chaos deep,
They roamed the void, no path to find,
A world unmoored, a soul confined.  
Verse 3
Her voice rang out, a silver thread,
Wove through dark where tears once bled,
The Crown’s sweet hum, her shield, her might,
Turned sorrow’s tide to fleeting light.
Yami watched, his vow complete,
Sword at rest by her feet,
Yet still the planet softly wailed,
A fractured dream, a tale unveiled.  
Outro
Oh, Lucifuga, sing it true,
Knight and Crown belong to you,
Golems sway in shadowed air,
A song of loss, beyond repair.
The music holds what words can’t say,
A story drifts, then fades away.
