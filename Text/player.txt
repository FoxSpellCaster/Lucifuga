Primary Attributes
Strength
Measures your character's muscular power. The higher your Strength, the more damage you do in combat and the more encumbrance you can carry before you become overloaded.
Endurance
Measures how healthy your character is. The higher your Endurance, the more Health and Stamina you have. Endurance also affects your other attributes such as drain resistance and regeneration bonuses.
Coordination
Measures your character's reflexes. The higher your Coordination, the better you fight and perform other dexterous actions.
Quickness
Measures how fast your character is. The higher your Quickness, the faster you can run and the quicker you attack in combat.
Focus
Measures the acuteness of your character's mind and senses. The higher your Focus, the better you are at magic and other mental skills.
Self

Health
Health represents the amount of damage your character can take without dying. Health can be raised directly as well as indirectly by raising Endurance.

Stamina
Stamina represents the amount of energy your character can expend without becoming exhausted. Stamina is used in attacking, defending, healing, jumping and even crafting. When stamina drops to 0, your melee and missile defences also drop to 0 and you will be incapable of attacking. In addition, you will suffer a -50% penalty to your weapon skill. Creatures are also effected by these penalties.
Stamina can be raised directly as well as indirectly by raising endurance. The base endurance attribute also increases your stamina regeneration bonus, which also affects stamina lost during combat.

Mana
Mana represents the amount of magical energy available to your character for casting spells. Mana can be raised directly as well as indirectly by raising Self.
