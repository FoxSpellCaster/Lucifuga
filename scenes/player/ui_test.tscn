[/ul]
[font_size=36]User Interface[/font_size]
Your Player section mentions Health, Energy, Threads, and a 2D physics-based Inventory, but lacks a cohesive UI to display them. I’ll design a minimalist, immersive UI that integrates with the Construct Golem’s crafted aesthetic and supports your gameplay (e.g., Abilities, Pickup, Cosmetics).
[font_size=27]UI Principles[/font_size]
[ul]Clarity: Show Health, Energy, Threads, and Inventory without cluttering the screen.  
Immersion: Use visuals inspired by Vertex Shards, Core Nodes, and Trash Gems to feel like the Golem’s internal display.  
Interactivity: Support Pickup’s physics-based Inventory and Cosmetic previews.  
Accessibility: Include toggles for Voice Chat (e.g., Proximity, Fade out death audio) and Abilities feedback.
[/ul]
[font_size=27]UI Layout[/font_size]
[ul]Screen Corners (non-intrusive, always visible):  
Top-Left: Health bar (horizontal, 100px long, red gem glow). Fades to cracked Obsidian at 0%, with “Unstable” warning when the Construct Golem Core detaches.  
Top-Right: Energy bar (vertical, 80px tall, blue Sapphire pulse). Drains during Additive Abilities (e.g., Glide), refills via Battery/Energy Station or Zen Garden.  
Bottom-Right: Threads counter (circular, Gold coin icon, e.g., “127 T”). Updates after Lucipeta trades or crafting.
Center-Screen (contextual, fades when idle):  
Cursor: A glowing Vertex Shard for Pickup, shifts color with Cosmetics (e.g., Emerald green). Expands to 6m range with Grapple.  
Ability Prompts: Icons for Core/Additive Abilities (e.g., Jump as a Pivot Joint, Slide as a Mesh Fiber). Glow when usable, gray out on cooldown or low Energy.
Bottom-Center (dynamic, toggles with input):  
Inventory Box: A 200x150px 2D physics window (styled like a Face Plate with Bronze edges). Trash or Components tumble inside when grabbed via Pickup.  
Mechanics: Items scale down (e.g., Medium Green Gem from 1m to 10px), bounce with 2D physics (friction 0.8, restitution 0.5). Max 20 items; excess items spill back into the environment with a clatter.  
Visuals: Box pulses faintly with Core Node energy. Overfull state shakes, with Cosmetics affecting spill effects (e.g., Fire sparks, Moss spores).  
Interaction: Drag items to Battery/Energy Station (onscreen slot) or Modular Crafting Station (recipe grid).
[/ul]
[font_size=27]Pause Menu (accessible via keypress):  [/font_size]
[ul]Tabs: Stats (view Health, Energy), Inventory (rearrange items), Cosmetics (preview Golem), Upgrades (buy with Threads), Voice Chat (toggle Mimic, Proximity).  
Style: A holographic Mesh Fiber grid, with Crystal accents per equipped Cosmetics.  
Cosmetic Preview: 3D Golem model rotates, zooms, shows Frame/Accents/Core changes (e.g., Driftwood + Amethyst).  
Voice Chat: Sliders for Proximity range (1-10m), checkbox for Fade out death audio (mutes when Health hits 0).
[/ul]
[font_size=27]UI Interactions[/font_size]
[ul]Health: When hit (e.g., by Slimy Salamander mucus), bar flashes red, Golem frame sparks (styled by Cosmetics, e.g., Iron rust flakes). At 0%, a 3-second animation shows the Core Node ejecting, with UI dimming except for a pulsing Core icon.  
Energy: Drains in chunks for Additive Abilities (e.g., Boost 30 Energy), refills 5 Energy/second near Zen Garden. Low Energy (<10%) grays out ability icons, adds Crystal flicker to cursor.  
Threads: Numbers pop up (+10, +25) after Lucipeta trades, with a Gold shimmer. Spending Threads (e.g., for Double Jump) shows a crafting animation (e.g., Pivot Joints locking).  
Inventory: Pickup pulls items into the 2D box, where they settle with physics (e.g., Large Orange Gem rolls heavier than Vertex Shard). Dragging to Battery/Energy Station plays a gem-crush sound, adding Energy.  
Abilities: Cooldowns show as a Loop Wire wrapping the icon (e.g., Long Jump 2s). Heavy Impact triggers a screen shake (toggleable in Pause Menu).  
Voice Chat: Proximity range shows as a faint Aether circle around the Golem in-game. Mimic mode overlays teammate voices with Cosmetic filters (e.g., Fire crackle, Void echo).
[/ul]
[font_size=27]Visual Notes[/font_size]
[ul]UI Theme: Inspired by Core Nodes and Trash Gems, with glowing edges and polygonal shapes. Cosmetics tint elements (e.g., Sapphire blue Health bar, Oak textured Inventory).  
Feedback
Low Health or Energy pulses the screen faintly. Inventory overflow plays a Metal clang or Crystal shatter.  
Todo: Add Reset Button to clear Cosmetics or reset UI layout to default (in Pause Menu).
[/ul]

[font_size=36]Cosmetics[/font_size]
Cosmetics allow players to customize the Construct Golem’s appearance for visual flair, with no impact on Health, Energy, Threads, or Abilities. They’re obtained through a random booster pack opening system, with effects that react to Abilities (e.g., Run, Glide), Stats (e.g., low Health), and environments (e.g., Construct Temple), displayed via the User Interface.
Cosmetic System
Purpose: Purely aesthetic customization of the Golem, with animations and particles for Abilities (e.g., Slide sparks), Stats (e.g., Core Mode glow), and locations (e.g., Island 1 seeps). No gameplay effects.  
Unlocks: Acquired by opening Booster Packs, random bundles purchased with Threads (earned from Lucipeta trades or Island 1 quests). Packs drop Cosmetics for specific Golem parts.  
Booster Pack Mechanics:  
Cost: 50 Threads per pack (bought in Zen Garden’s Cosmetic Kiosk, a new UI or location).  
Contents: 3 random Cosmetics (1 Frame, 1 Accents, 1 Core), with rarity tiers:  
Common (60% chance, e.g., Oak, Iron).  
Uncommon (30% chance, e.g., Marble, Bronze).  
Rare (10% chance, e.g., Amethyst, Fire).
Duplicates: Convert to 5 Threads (e.g., a second Quartz Core refunds 5 Threads).  
Opening: UI shows a pack exploding into Vertex Shard particles, revealing 3 Cosmetics with rarity-colored glows (Common: white, Uncommon: blue, Rare: purple).
Application: Equipped in the Cosmetics Tab (Pause Menu), where players assign visuals to three parts:  
Frame (body, covers Edge Rods, Face Plates): Sets main texture (e.g., Steel sheen).  
Accents (joints, seams, covers Pivot Joints, Loop Wires): Adds details (e.g., Gold filigree).  
Core (heart, covers Core Node): Defines glow (e.g., Emerald pulse).
Dynamic Visuals: Shift with game states:  
Abilities: E.g., Boost trails Storm lightning, Crouch sheds Earth moss.  
Stats: E.g., low Health cracks Obsidian Frame, high Threads brightens Sapphire Accents.  
Environment: E.g., Island 1 wets Driftwood Frame, Zen Garden calms Ice Core frost.
UI Integration: Cosmetics Tab shows a 3D Golem preview (rotate/zoom, 200x200px). Inventory Pickup tints Trash in Cosmetic style (e.g., Fire warms Medium Green Gem). Voice Chat icons reflect Cosmetics (e.g., Moss green).
Cosmetic Categories
Five categories with 4 options each, condensed for clarity, drawn from your originals. All are random drops from Booster Packs, with visuals tied to Spawn Island and Island 1.
Wood (Natural, echoes Island 1’s forests)  
Oak (Common): Warm, knotted grain. Run scatters sawdust, Core Mode splinters Frame.  
Bamboo (Uncommon): Sleek, pale segments. Slide clacks softly, Pickup hums with Accents.  
Driftwood (Uncommon): Gnarled, sea-worn. Glide drips water, Island 1 seeps darken Frame.  
Ebony (Rare): Glossy black sheen. Double Jump trails smoke, low Health dulls Core.  
Visual Notes: Frame has bark texture, Accents show carved seams, Core glows like ember-lit wood.
Metal (Industrial, reflects Construct Temple)  
Iron (Common): Rusty, pitted surface. Roll sparks, Wall Jump grinds Accents. Default unlock (no pack needed).  
Bronze (Uncommon): Warm, aged patina. Boost vents steam, Threads trades glint Core.

Visual-Only: Kept Cosmetics purely aesthetic, with no gameplay impact (e.g., no Health regen, Energy boosts). Animations tied to Abilities, Stats, and environments (e.g., Slide’s Ice frost, Island 1’s Driftwood wetting).  
Structure Intact: Retained Frame/Accents/Core slots, five categories (Wood, Metal, Stone, Crystal, Elemental), and 4 options each, using your originals where possible.  
World Ties: Linked visuals to Zen Garden (pack purchases), Island 1 (e.g., Sandstone Frame dust), and Construct Temple (e.g., Gold Accents shine), with Threads connecting to Lucipeta economy.
Why This Works
Randomized Fun: Booster Packs add excitement with random drops (Common Iron to Rare Fire), fueled by Threads from Lucipeta or Construct Temple, encouraging play without crafting Cosmetics.  
Purely Visual: No stat changes—Cosmetics only shift textures, particles, and animations (e.g., Boost’s Fire embers, low Health’s Obsidian cracks), keeping Health and Energy untouched.  
Player Expression: Mix Frame/Accents/Core (e.g., Bamboo + Amethyst + Storm) for unique looks, previewed in UI. Voice Chat icons (e.g., Marble white) add flair.  
World Immersion: Visuals enhance Island 1 (e.g., Earth Frame sprouts), Zen Garden (e.g., Ice Core calms), and Abilities (e.g., Glide’s Quartz prisms), tying to the Golem’s world.  
UI Fit: Cosmetics Tab and pack-opening screen are clear, with Inventory and cursor reflecting Cosmetics (e.g., Gold Frame gilds UI box), making style cohesive.
Next Steps
If this hits the mark, I can:
Detail Booster Pack visuals (e.g., rarity animations, Cosmetic Kiosk design).  
Expand Cosmetic effects for Abilities (e.g., Wall Jump with Steel).  
Refine UI for Cosmetics Tab (e.g., zoom controls, sound toggles).  
Suggest Threads sources for packs (e.g., Lucipeta quest rewards).  
Or pivot to Stats (e.g., Health regen tweaks), Inventory, or Voice Chat.

# User Interface
Your Player section mentions Health, Energy, Threads, and a 2D physics-based Inventory, but lacks a cohesive UI to display them. I’ll design a minimalist, immersive UI that integrates with the Construct Golem’s crafted aesthetic and supports your gameplay (e.g., Abilities, Pickup, Cosmetics).
## UI Principles
- Clarity: Show Health, Energy, Threads, and Inventory without cluttering the screen.  
- Immersion: Use visuals inspired by Vertex Shards, Core Nodes, and Trash Gems to feel like the Golem’s internal display.  
- Interactivity: Support Pickup’s physics-based Inventory and Cosmetic previews.  
- Accessibility: Include toggles for Voice Chat (e.g., Proximity, Fade out death audio) and Abilities feedback.
## UI Layout
- Screen Corners (non-intrusive, always visible):  
- Top-Left: Health bar (horizontal, 100px long, red gem glow). Fades to cracked Obsidian at 0%, with “Unstable” warning when the Construct Golem Core detaches.  
- Top-Right: Energy bar (vertical, 80px tall, blue Sapphire pulse). Drains during Additive Abilities (e.g., Glide), refills via Battery/Energy Station or Zen Garden.  
- Bottom-Right: Threads counter (circular, Gold coin icon, e.g., “127 T”). Updates after Lucipeta trades or crafting.
- Center-Screen (contextual, fades when idle):  
- Cursor: A glowing Vertex Shard for Pickup, shifts color with Cosmetics (e.g., Emerald green). Expands to 6m range with Grapple.  
- Ability Prompts: Icons for Core/Additive Abilities (e.g., Jump as a Pivot Joint, Slide as a Mesh Fiber). Glow when usable, gray out on cooldown or low Energy.
- Bottom-Center (dynamic, toggles with input):  
- Inventory Box: A 200x150px 2D physics window (styled like a Face Plate with Bronze edges). Trash or Components tumble inside when grabbed via Pickup.  
- Mechanics: Items scale down (e.g., Medium Green Gem from 1m to 10px), bounce with 2D physics (friction 0.8, restitution 0.5). Max 20 items; excess items spill back into the environment with a clatter.  
- Visuals: Box pulses faintly with Core Node energy. Overfull state shakes, with Cosmetics affecting spill effects (e.g., Fire sparks, Moss spores).  
- Interaction: Drag items to Battery/Energy Station (onscreen slot) or Modular Crafting Station (recipe grid).
## Pause Menu (accessible via keypress):  
- Tabs: Stats (view Health, Energy), Inventory (rearrange items), Cosmetics (preview Golem), Upgrades (buy with Threads), Voice Chat (toggle Mimic, Proximity).  
- Style: A holographic Mesh Fiber grid, with Crystal accents per equipped Cosmetics.  
- Cosmetic Preview: 3D Golem model rotates, zooms, shows Frame/Accents/Core changes (e.g., Driftwood + Amethyst).  
- Voice Chat: Sliders for Proximity range (1-10m), checkbox for Fade out death audio (mutes when Health hits 0).
## UI Interactions
- Health: When hit (e.g., by Slimy Salamander mucus), bar flashes red, Golem frame sparks (styled by Cosmetics, e.g., Iron rust flakes). At 0%, a 3-second animation shows the Core Node ejecting, with UI dimming except for a pulsing Core icon.  
- Energy: Drains in chunks for Additive Abilities (e.g., Boost 30 Energy), refills 5 Energy/second near Zen Garden. Low Energy (<10%) grays out ability icons, adds Crystal flicker to cursor.  
- Threads: Numbers pop up (+10, +25) after Lucipeta trades, with a Gold shimmer. Spending Threads (e.g., for Double Jump) shows a crafting animation (e.g., Pivot Joints locking).  
- Inventory: Pickup pulls items into the 2D box, where they settle with physics (e.g., Large Orange Gem rolls heavier than Vertex Shard). Dragging to Battery/Energy Station plays a gem-crush sound, adding Energy.  
- Abilities: Cooldowns show as a Loop Wire wrapping the icon (e.g., Long Jump 2s). Heavy Impact triggers a screen shake (toggleable in Pause Menu).  
- Voice Chat: Proximity range shows as a faint Aether circle around the Golem in-game. Mimic mode overlays teammate voices with Cosmetic filters (e.g., Fire crackle, Void echo).
## Visual Notes
- UI Theme: Inspired by Core Nodes and Trash Gems, with glowing edges and polygonal shapes. Cosmetics tint elements (e.g., Sapphire blue Health bar, Oak textured Inventory).  
- Feedback
- Low Health or Energy pulses the screen faintly. Inventory overflow plays a Metal clang or Crystal shatter.  
- Todo: Add Reset Button to clear Cosmetics or reset UI layout to default (in Pause Menu).

# Cosmetics
Cosmetics allow players to customize the Construct Golem’s appearance for visual flair, with no impact on Health, Energy, Threads, or Abilities. They’re obtained through a random booster pack opening system, with effects that react to Abilities (e.g., Run, Glide), Stats (e.g., low Health), and environments (e.g., Construct Temple), displayed via the User Interface.
Cosmetic System
Purpose: Purely aesthetic customization of the Golem, with animations and particles for Abilities (e.g., Slide sparks), Stats (e.g., Core Mode glow), and locations (e.g., Island 1 seeps). No gameplay effects.  
Unlocks: Acquired by opening Booster Packs, random bundles purchased with Threads (earned from Lucipeta trades or Island 1 quests). Packs drop Cosmetics for specific Golem parts.  
Booster Pack Mechanics:  
Cost: 50 Threads per pack (bought in Zen Garden’s Cosmetic Kiosk, a new UI or location).  
Contents: 3 random Cosmetics (1 Frame, 1 Accents, 1 Core), with rarity tiers:  
Common (60% chance, e.g., Oak, Iron).  
Uncommon (30% chance, e.g., Marble, Bronze).  
Rare (10% chance, e.g., Amethyst, Fire).
Duplicates: Convert to 5 Threads (e.g., a second Quartz Core refunds 5 Threads).  
Opening: UI shows a pack exploding into Vertex Shard particles, revealing 3 Cosmetics with rarity-colored glows (Common: white, Uncommon: blue, Rare: purple).
Application: Equipped in the Cosmetics Tab (Pause Menu), where players assign visuals to three parts:  
Frame (body, covers Edge Rods, Face Plates): Sets main texture (e.g., Steel sheen).  
Accents (joints, seams, covers Pivot Joints, Loop Wires): Adds details (e.g., Gold filigree).  
Core (heart, covers Core Node): Defines glow (e.g., Emerald pulse).
Dynamic Visuals: Shift with game states:  
Abilities: E.g., Boost trails Storm lightning, Crouch sheds Earth moss.  
Stats: E.g., low Health cracks Obsidian Frame, high Threads brightens Sapphire Accents.  
Environment: E.g., Island 1 wets Driftwood Frame, Zen Garden calms Ice Core frost.
UI Integration: Cosmetics Tab shows a 3D Golem preview (rotate/zoom, 200x200px). Inventory Pickup tints Trash in Cosmetic style (e.g., Fire warms Medium Green Gem). Voice Chat icons reflect Cosmetics (e.g., Moss green).
