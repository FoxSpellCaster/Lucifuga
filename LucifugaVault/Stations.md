# Finishing Actions
Garnishing - Adding decorative or flavorful elements, like herbs or lemon slices, to enhance presentation.

Tossing - Mixing ingredients lightly, often for salads or pasta dishes.

Plating - Arranging food on a plate for serving.

Resting - Letting cooked food sit to redistribute juices, especially for meats.

Tasting - Sampling food to adjust seasoning or check doneness.

Cooling - Allowing food to reach a lower temperature before serving or storing.

Straining - Separating solids from liquids, like draining pasta or making broth.

Pureeing - Blending food into a smooth consistency (e.g., soups, sauces).

Reducing - Simmering a liquid to thicken it and intensify flavor (e.g., sauces).

Emulsifying - Combining liquids that don’t naturally mix, like oil and vinegar, for dressings or sauces.

# Specialized Techniques
Fermenting - Allowing food to undergo controlled microbial growth (e.g., yogurt, kimchi).

Canning - Preserving food in jars through heat processing.

Smoking - Cooking or flavoring food with smoke from burning wood (e.g., smoked salmon).

Sous-vide - Cooking vacuum-sealed food in a precise, low-temperature water bath.

Tempering - Gradually heating or cooling ingredients, like eggs or chocolate, to prevent curdling or seizing.

Infusing - Steeping ingredients in a liquid to impart flavor (e.g., infused oils).

Caramelizing - Heating sugar or ingredients to develop a rich, sweet flavor (e.g., onions, desserts).

Proofing - Allowing dough to rise before baking.

# Tool-Specific Actions
Grinding - Breaking down ingredients into smaller particles, like grinding spices or coffee.

Blending - Combining ingredients into a smooth mixture using a blender.

Whisking - Beating ingredients to incorporate air or combine smoothly (e.g., eggs, sauces).

Mashing - Crushing food into a softer consistency, like mashed potatoes.

Pressing - Applying pressure to extract liquid or shape food, like pressing tofu.



# General Terms for Extracting Liquid
Juicing - Extracting liquid (juice) from fruits, vegetables, or other ingredients, typically using a juicer, reamer, or manual squeezing (e.g., juicing oranges).

Squeezing - Applying pressure to release liquid, often by hand or with a tool like a citrus press (e.g., squeezing a lemon).

Pressing - Using force to extract liquid, often with a tool like a garlic press, potato ricer, or tofu press (e.g., pressing grapes for wine).

Straining - Separating liquid from solids by pouring through a sieve, cheesecloth, or strainer (e.g., straining broth to remove solids).

Draining - Removing excess liquid by letting it flow out, often using a colander or perforated tool (e.g., draining pasta).

Filtering - Passing liquid through a fine medium (e.g., coffee filter, cheesecloth) to remove particles while retaining the liquid (e.g., filtering homemade almond milk).

Expressing - A formal term for squeezing or pressing out liquid, often used in technical recipes (e.g., expressing oil from herbs).

Extracting - A broad term for obtaining liquid, often implying a specific process like juicing or infusing (e.g., extracting vanilla essence).

Specific Techniques and Processes
Rendering - Heating fat-containing ingredients (e.g., bacon, duck skin) to melt and extract liquid fat, leaving solids behind.

Clarifying - Removing impurities from a liquid, often by straining or skimming, to obtain a clear liquid (e.g., clarifying butter to make ghee).

Infusing - Steeping ingredients in a liquid to extract flavors, where the liquid itself may be the focus (e.g., infusing herbs in oil).

Decanting - Pouring off liquid carefully to separate it from sediment or solids (e.g., decanting wine or broth).

Centrifuging - Using a high-speed spinning machine to separate liquid from solids, common in industrial juicing or laboratory settings (less common in home kitchens).

Percolating - Passing liquid through a porous substance to extract soluble components, often used for coffee or in older extraction methods.

Leaching - Soaking ingredients to draw out liquid or soluble components, sometimes unintentional (e.g., soaking vegetables to remove excess salt).

Macerating - Soaking or steeping ingredients (often fruits) to release their juices, sometimes aided by sugar or alcohol (e.g., macerating berries).

Reaming - Specifically using a reamer to extract juice from citrus fruits by twisting or scraping the flesh.

Triturating - A rare term for grinding or crushing to release liquid, sometimes used in pharmaceutical or culinary contexts for juicing.

Exuding - Allowing liquid to naturally seep out, often through osmosis or time (e.g., salting eggplant to exude water).

Sweating - Cooking ingredients (e.g., onions, mushrooms) over low heat to release their natural liquids without browning.

Specialized or Tool-Specific Terms
Ricening - Using a potato ricer to press soft ingredients (e.g., potatoes, cooked fruits) and extract liquid or semi-liquid content.

Milling - Grinding wet ingredients to release liquid, as in traditional olive oil production or sugarcane milling.

Cold-pressing - Extracting liquid (usually oil or juice) without heat to preserve flavor and nutrients (e.g., cold-pressed olive oil).

Hydraulic pressing - Using a hydraulic press to extract liquid, common in large-scale production like wine or cider making.

Expelling - A term used in oil extraction, where seeds or nuts are pressed to expel their oils (e.g., expeller-pressed canola oil).

Wringing - Twisting or squeezing a cloth (e.g., cheesecloth) to extract liquid from a mixture, like wringing out nut milk.

Reducing - Boiling a liquid to evaporate water and concentrate it, indirectly extracting a more intense liquid (e.g., reducing broth).

Skimming - Removing liquid fat or foam from the surface of a mixture to isolate it (e.g., skimming fat from stock).
