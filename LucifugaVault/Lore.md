The Knight of Darkness, Yami, guards a hollow throne.
In his madness, he crowns his Shadow Princess, Lucifugia.
A seat of power forsaken tears stain all that remains.

## Echoes in the Spin
Verse 1
I trace the air with every turn,
A melody where starlight burns,
The Crown atop, it gleams, it sways,
I dance through nights, I dance through days.
Each step I take, a fleeting sign,
A woven thread in light divine,
I sing of joy, but shadows creep,
A whispered truth I dare not weep.  
Chorus
Spin, oh spin, where colors flare,
Catch the glow in twilight air,
Flee the dawn, seek the hue,
Find the note that leads to you.
Twirl and leap, the beat ascends,
Seek the truth where rhythm bends.  
Verse 2
My knight stands firm, his blade so cold,
He guards my dance, a tale untold,
The Crown’s soft hum, a fragile chain,
I move in place, I can’t refrain.
I weave my steps, they shimmer wide,
A secret pulse I dare to hide,
He holds my world in shadowed gaze,
My dance a maze through endless haze.  
Chorus
Spin, oh spin, where colors flare,
Catch the glow in twilight air,
Flee the dawn, seek the hue,
Find the note that leads to you.
Twirl and leap, the beat ascends,
Seek the truth where rhythm bends.  
Bridge
The planet sighs, its shades grow pale,
Stone guards drift on broken trails,
I whirl in light, a tethered flame,
My dance unfolds a hidden name.
Three peaks that gleam, they mark my stage,
Unweave their song, unlock my cage.
Yami stands, he does not sway,
My steps confined, I fade away.  
Outro
I’ll dance, I’ll hum, ‘til skies unfold,
A cryptic step in stories told,
Lucifuga spins, her echoes blend,
A fleeting sign to find a friend.
The rhythm weaves where none can see,
A shadowed wish—will you reach me?

## Welcome to the Construct Hanger (Remastered)
Verse 1
In shadows deep where silence dwells,
Yami rose, the tales all tell,
Her knight in black, with sword so true,
Swore to chase what darkness knew.
A Crown of Power, gleaming bright,
Held the world in endless light,
He carved its throne from trembling stone,
To claim it for her, hers alone.  
Chorus
Oh, Lucifuga, hear the call,
Sing your heart, don’t let it fall,
Strings of fate in every line,
A song to bind the tears divine.
The planet fades, its voice grows thin,
Lost in echoes, trapped within.  
Verse 2
Through starless fields, his blade sang low,
A trail of dusk where shadows grow,
The Crown in hand, he turned to flee,
To gift his queen her melody.
Lucifuga stood, her eyes like flame,
Fled the sun, her whispered name,
She took the prize, her fingers danced,
A tune awoke, the world entranced.  
Chorus
Oh, Lucifuga, hear the call,
Sing your heart, don’t let it fall,
Strings of fate in every line,
A song to bind the tears divine.
The planet fades, its voice grows thin,
Lost in echoes, trapped within.  
Bridge
But then the earth began to sigh,
A mournful hum, a muted cry,
Its light went dim, its song erased,
Friends of old in silence placed.
Golems stirred from ancient sleep,
Stone and steel in chaos deep,
They roamed the void, no path to find,
A world unmoored, a soul confined.  
Verse 3
Her voice rang out, a silver thread,
Wove through dark where tears once bled,
The Crown’s sweet hum, her shield, her might,
Turned sorrow’s tide to fleeting light.
Yami watched, his vow complete,
Sword at rest by her feet,
Yet still the planet softly wailed,
A fractured dream, a tale unveiled.  
Outro
Oh, Lucifuga, sing it true,
Knight and Crown belong to you,
Golems sway in shadowed air,
A song of loss, beyond repair.
The music holds what words can’t say,
A story drifts, then fades away. 

## will it find its way?
Verse 1
I paint the air with golden tones,
A rhythm born of silent stones,
The Crown I bear, it sings so clear,
A mirrored world I hold so near.
Each beat I craft, a drifting veil,
A fleeting step where shadows sail,
I hum of light, but skies unwind,
A silent thread I leave behind.  
Chorus
Rise, oh rise, where colors play,
Catch the pulse in fleeting day,
Turn from shine, seek the drift,
Find the hum where dreams uplift.
Twist and flow, the tune takes flight,
Trace the echo out of sight.  
Verse 2
My knight beside, his steel so bright,
He forged my throne from endless night,
The Crown’s embrace, a warm disguise,
Yet dims the stars in my own eyes.
I pluck the strings, they shimmer low,
A hidden wave where secrets grow,
Beneath the glow, a muted call,
A path unseen, beyond the wall.  
Chorus
Rise, oh rise, where colors play,
Catch the pulse in fleeting day,
Turn from shine, seek the drift,
Find the hum where dreams uplift.
Twist and flow, the tune takes flight,
Trace the echo out of sight.  
Bridge
The earth grows faint, its hues unwind,
Stone figures roam, their minds confined,
I’m draped in light, a fragile frame,
My melody hides a different name.
Three points aloft, they hold my fate,
Unravel tones, before too late.  
Outro
I’ll sway, I’ll weave, through endless skies,
A subtle hint in every rise,
Lucifuga hums, her voice takes leave,
A song to guide what none believe.
The rhythm fades where shadows play,
A silent wish—will it find its way?

## will you find me? 
Verse 1
I thread my voice through silver haze,
A melody in endless maze,
The Crown above, it gleams so wide,
Its whispered hum, my guide, my tide.
Each note I spin, a fleeting shade,
A dance of light where shadows played,
I sing of stars, but skies are torn,
A quiet wish, a hope unborn.  
Chorus
Sway, oh sway, where echoes bloom,
Find the thread in twilight’s gloom,
Flee the dawn, chase the glow,
Seek what hums where shadows flow.
Spin and glide, the rhythm gleams,
Trace the song through hidden dreams.  
Verse 2
My knight stands close, his blade so still,
He brought the prize to bend my will,
Its power sings, a vibrant veil,
Yet whispers drift, a fading trail.
I strum the air, the notes take wing,
A fleeting arc, a fragile string,
Beneath the shine, a current deep,
A secret tide I dare not keep.  
Chorus
Sway, oh sway, where echoes bloom,
Find the thread in twilight’s gloom,
Flee the dawn, chase the glow,
Seek what hums where shadows flow.
Spin and glide, the rhythm gleams,
Trace the song through hidden dreams.  
Bridge
The planet dims, its colors stray,
Stone guards march, they drift, they sway,
I’m bound in light, a mirrored stage,
My tune unfolds, a shadowed gauge.
Three peaks that shimmer, hold the key,
Unweave their pulse, what might you see?  
Outro
I’ll hum, I’ll weave, ‘til skies align,
A fleeting spark, a coded sign,
Lucifuga sings, her echoes stray,
A melody to drift away.
The rhythm bends where none can see,
A whispered wish—will you find me?
