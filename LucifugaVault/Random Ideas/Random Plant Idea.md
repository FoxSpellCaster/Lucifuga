- Resin: Sap from pine or other trees works. Scrape it off bark after it oozes out naturally (like from a cut or broken branch). It’s sticky, dries hard, and can be used as a glue or coating.
    
- Twigs or Sticks: Snap them off bushes or trees. Strip the bark if you want a smoother look—they’re great for structure like stems or mini trellises.
    
- Leaves: Pick fresh or fallen ones. Press them flat to dry (between heavy books works) for collage pieces or stencils.
    
- Bark: Peel it off fallen branches or logs. Thin strips can be woven into mats or used as textured accents.
    
- Pine Needles: Gather from the ground under evergreens. Bundle them for mini wreaths or use as filler for a forest vibe.
    
- Flower Petals: Pluck from wildflowers or garden plants (ones you’re okay losing). Dry them by air or pressing for color pops in crafts.
    
- Grass or Reeds: Cut from a yard or field. Dry them out and braid or bundle for simple plant-like textures.
    
- Seeds or Pods: Collect acorns, pinecones, or any seed heads. They’re ready-made decorations or can be split apart for smaller bits.
