# Base Components

## Vertex Shard

- Description: A small, glowing crystal or point-like fragment.
- Role: The fundamental raw material, the "atom" of all crafting.
- Source: Mined, scavenged, or dropped by enemies.
- AI Task: 
## Edge Rod

- Description: A straight, sturdy bar connecting two points.
- Role: Links vertices to form structure and outlines.
- Source: Crafted from 2 Vertex Shards + a binding material (e.g., wire, glue).
- AI Task: 
## Face Plate

- Description: A flat, polygonal surface (e.g., triangle, quad).
- Role: Provides surface area and enclosure for 3D forms.
- Source: Crafted from 3-4 Edge Rods + a filler (e.g., metal, cloth).
- AI Task: 
# Intermediate Components

## Loop Wire

- Description: A flexible, closed loop of material.
- Role: Reinforces edges or binds faces into stable shapes.
- Source: Crafted from 3 Vertex Shards + heat/pressure (e.g., smelter).
- AI Task: 
## Mesh Fiber

- Description: A web-like material for connecting faces.
- Role: Ties multiple Face Plates into a cohesive mesh or flexible surface.
- Source: Harvested from organic/synthetic sources, processed by AI.
- AI Task: 
## Pivot Joint

- Description: A movable connector for edges or faces.
- Role: Adds articulation or rotation to crafted objects.
- Source: Crafted from 2 Vertex Shards + 1 Edge Rod.
- AI Task: 
## Surface Shard

- Description: A small, rough fragment of a face.
- Role: A cheap filler or precursor to Face Plates.
- Source: Scavenged or broken down from Face Plates.
- AI Task:
## Core Node

- Description: A dense, energy-rich cluster of vertices.
- Role: Powers or catalyzes advanced crafting processes.
- Source: Rare drop or crafted from 5 Vertex Shards + a reagent.
- AI Task:
## Edge Band

- Description: A wide, flat strip of connected edges.
- Role: Wraps or reinforces larger components.
- Source: Crafted from 2 Edge Rods + a binding agent.
- AI Task:
## Face Frame

- Description: An empty polygonal outline of edges.
- Role: A lightweight frame or step toward a Face Plate.
- Source: Assembled from 3-4 Edge Rods.
- AI Task:
# How It Looks in the Game

Imagine a crafting ecosystem where these components flow through an automated pipeline managed by AI characters. Here’s a snapshot of how it might feel:
## Resource Flow

- Starting Point: Vertex Shards are everywhere—scattered across the map like ore veins or debris. Gatherers swarm to collect them, depositing them in storage hubs.

- Processing: Crafters take Vertex Shards and churn out Edge Rods and Loop Wire at basic stations. Some experiment with Pivot Joints for moving parts.

- Refinement: Face Frames emerge as Crafters link Edge Rods into outlines. These either get filled into Face Plates or combined with Mesh Fiber for flexible surfaces. Surface Shards patch gaps cheaply.

- Advanced Crafting: Managers oversee rare Core Nodes, directing Crafters to fuse them with Edge Bands and Face Plates for high-tier potential (e.g., power cores, durable meshes).
# Visuals

- [ ] Vertex Shards: Tiny, shimmering points glowing faintly in piles.
- [ ] Edge Rods: Sleek, metallic or wooden sticks stacked like lumber.
- [ ] Face Plates: Flat, polygonal slabs—triangles, squares—polished or rugged depending on the filler.
- [ ] Loop Wire: Coiled rings of thin material, pulsing faintly if energized.
- [ ] Mesh Fiber: Gossamer threads bundled like silk or netting.
- [ ] Pivot Joint: Small, mechanical hinges clicking as they flex.
- [ ] Surface Shard: Jagged, irregular flakes, rougher than Face Plates.
- [ ] Core Node: A dense, radiant orb crackling with energy.
- [ ] Edge Band: Broad, ribbon-like strips rolled up or stretched taut.
- [ ] Face Frame: Hollow geometric outlines, like skeletal polygons.

## Automation in Action

- Gatherers: Dart around, scooping Vertex Shards and Surface Shards, occasionally snagging Mesh Fiber from odd sources.

- Crafters: Huddle at machines—smelters for Loop Wire, presses for Edge Bands, assemblers for Face Frames and Pivot Joints.

- Managers: Hover over Core Node stashes, directing resources to optimize the chain.

- Flow: Conveyor belts hum, moving Vertex Shards to Edge Rod stations, then Edge Rods to Face Frame assemblers, with Mesh Fiber weaving it all together.
### What This Enables

This system gives you a modular base. Players and AI can mix these components later into anything—say, a Mesh Fiber net with Face Frames, a Core Node-powered engine with Pivot Joints, or a simple Edge Band sling. It’s scalable: start with Vertex Shards for basic needs, unlock Core Nodes for endgame flair.
