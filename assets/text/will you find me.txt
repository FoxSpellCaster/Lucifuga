will you find me? 
Verse 1
I thread my voice through silver haze,
A melody in endless maze,
The Crown above, it gleams so wide,
Its whispered hum, my guide, my tide.
Each note I spin, a fleeting shade,
A dance of light where shadows played,
I sing of stars, but skies are torn,
A quiet wish, a hope unborn.  
Chorus
Sway, oh sway, where echoes bloom,
Find the thread in twilight’s gloom,
Flee the dawn, chase the glow,
Seek what hums where shadows flow.
Spin and glide, the rhythm gleams,
Trace the song through hidden dreams.  
Verse 2
My knight stands close, his blade so still,
He brought the prize to bend my will,
Its power sings, a vibrant veil,
Yet whispers drift, a fading trail.
I strum the air, the notes take wing,
A fleeting arc, a fragile string,
Beneath the shine, a current deep,
A secret tide I dare not keep.  
Chorus
Sway, oh sway, where echoes bloom,
Find the thread in twilight’s gloom,
Flee the dawn, chase the glow,
Seek what hums where shadows flow.
Spin and glide, the rhythm gleams,
Trace the song through hidden dreams.  
Bridge
The planet dims, its colors stray,
Stone guards march, they drift, they sway,
I’m bound in light, a mirrored stage,
My tune unfolds, a shadowed gauge.
Three peaks that shimmer, hold the key,
Unweave their pulse, what might you see?  
Outro
I’ll hum, I’ll weave, ‘til skies align,
A fleeting spark, a coded sign,
Lucifuga sings, her echoes stray,
A melody to drift away.
The rhythm bends where none can see,
A whispered wish—will you find me?
