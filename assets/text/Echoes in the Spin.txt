Echoes in the Spin
Verse 1
I trace the air with every turn,
A melody where starlight burns,
The Crown atop, it gleams, it sways,
I dance through nights, I dance through days.
Each step I take, a fleeting sign,
A woven thread in light divine,
I sing of joy, but shadows creep,
A whispered truth I dare not weep.  
Chorus
Spin, oh spin, where colors flare,
Catch the glow in twilight air,
Flee the dawn, seek the hue,
Find the note that leads to you.
Twirl and leap, the beat ascends,
Seek the truth where rhythm bends.  
Verse 2
My knight stands firm, his blade so cold,
He guards my dance, a tale untold,
The Crown’s soft hum, a fragile chain,
I move in place, I can’t refrain.
I weave my steps, they shimmer wide,
A secret pulse I dare to hide,
He holds my world in shadowed gaze,
My dance a maze through endless haze.  
Chorus
Spin, oh spin, where colors flare,
Catch the glow in twilight air,
Flee the dawn, seek the hue,
Find the note that leads to you.
Twirl and leap, the beat ascends,
Seek the truth where rhythm bends.  
Bridge
The planet sighs, its shades grow pale,
Stone guards drift on broken trails,
I whirl in light, a tethered flame,
My dance unfolds a hidden name.
Three peaks that gleam, they mark my stage,
Unweave their song, unlock my cage.
Yami stands, he does not sway,
My steps confined, I fade away.  
Outro
I’ll dance, I’ll hum, ‘til skies unfold,
A cryptic step in stories told,
Lucifuga spins, her echoes blend,
A fleeting sign to find a friend.
The rhythm weaves where none can see,
A shadowed wish—will you reach me?
